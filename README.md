# Live Aber Die (Ludum Dare 46)

Created using [Macabre2D](https://github.com/BrettStory/Macabre2D), which is built on top of MonoGame. To build this code, you will need to clone [Macabre2D](https://github.com/BrettStory/Macabre2D) and then clone this git repository directly into a folder titled 'Project' within that Macabre2D repository. It's a bit cumbersome, but the engine is a work in progress and this has been the easiest way to work with it up to this point.

This was created with [pre-release 0.3.12.0 of Macabre2D](https://github.com/BrettStory/Macabre2D/releases/tag/0.3.12.0), please use that when attempting to build the source.

## Controls

WASD, analog stick, or D-Pad should work for movement.

Space bar, or the bottom face button on a controller (A for Xbox, X for Playstation) will jump. Just knock your body into the food and watch it fly.
