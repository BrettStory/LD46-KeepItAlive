# LD46-KeepItAlive

Created using [Macabre2D](https://github.com/BrettStory/Macabre2D), which is built on top of MonoGame. To build this code, you will need to clone [Macabre2D](https://github.com/BrettStory/Macabre2D) and then clone this git repository directly into a folder titled 'Project' within that Macabre2D repository. It's a bit cumbersome, but the engine is a work in progress and this has been the easiest way to work with it up to this point.
